## Inspiration
Health data is not stored for a long time and securely
Also for sharing Health records there is no secure mechanism that leverages new upcoming technology
## What it does
It stores data on the Arweave network
Provide Simple UI for integrations with different CryptoCurrency and Wallet
Integration with native Arweave Wallet
Add tags, key-value pairs 
Show the different transaction, payment and block data to the user
## How we built it
Going through different documentations and with help of community support on Discord
## Challenges we ran into
Provide different integrations into one platform
Used GraphQL for the first time
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Able to complete the project that is useful, leverage new upcoming technology and different from existing solutions
## What we learned
Learned about Arweave
Learned how to integrate several functionalities in one App
Learned GraphQL
## What's next for Health Record Storage
I would like to take this to level where people actually use this
Deploy it in some decentralise platform
Provide functionality for user to directly share records (if they want) with certified research facilities
Provide a certified list of medical person with whom user can directly share reports, and he inturn will share questionare and prescription for the user
